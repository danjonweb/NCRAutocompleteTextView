An NSTextView subclass that implements a popover to autocomplete words.

Installation
===
Drag `NCRAutocompleteTextView.h` and `NCRAutocompleteTextView.m` files onto your project. In interface builder, change the class of your `NSTextView` to `NCRAutocompleteTextView`. I've only tested this on 10.9, but it should work on 10.7+ with ARC.

Usage
===
Set the property `wordlist` on the `NCRAutocompleteTextView` to an array of words you want to autocomplete. That's it! Note about capitalization: words will match even if they aren't the same case. When a match is selected from the autocomplete popover, the case from the suggestion will replace the case the user typed.

You can (optionally) supply images for word suggestions. Just set the `delegate` property of the `NCRAutocompleteTextView` and implement the method `-(NSImage *)imageForWord:(NSString *)word` in your delegate. The `word` parameter is the full word that is suggested in the autocomplete popover. You just need to return the appropiate image. See the example project.

There are several options that are all currently set by `#define`'s at the top of the `.m` file:
+ `#define MAX_RESULTS 10`
Sets the maximum number of lines of autocomplete suggestions. You can always scroll to see the rest of the matches. A smaller number of matches will shrink the popover window.

+ `#define HIGHLIGHT_COLOR [NSColor colorWithCalibratedRed:0.474 green:0.588 blue:0.743 alpha:1]`
Sets the color of the highlight when selecting a match.

+ `#define HIGHLIGHT_RADIUS 4.0`
The highlight can have a radius. Set it to 0 if you don't won't a rounded rect.

+ `#define INTERCELL_SPACING NSMakeSize(0, 5.0)`
Specifies the amount of space between rows. The first number (the horizontal spacing) won't have an effect because there is only one column at this time.

+ `#define POPOVER_WIDTH 250.0`
The total width of the popover. The height is adjusted dynamically depending on how many matches are found.

+ `#define POPOVER_PADDING 3.0`
The amount of space between the edge of the popover and the tableview displaying the matches.

+ `#define POPOVER_APPEARANCE NSPopoverAppearanceHUD` or `#define POPOVER_APPEARANCE NSPopoverAppearanceMinimal`
Sets the appearance of the popover. Apple offers two: `NSPopoverAppearanceHUD` is dark and `NSPopoverAppearanceMinimal` is light. You would want to change the font color (see below) to something dark if you use `NSPopoverAppearanceMinimal`.

+ `#define POPOVER_FONT [NSFont fontWithName:@"Menlo" size:12.0]`
Sets the font used to display matches. Fixed-width fonts tend to work better.

+ `#define POPOVER_BOLDFONT [NSFont fontWithName:@"Menlo-Bold" size:13.0]`
The characters that have already been typed can be set in a different font. The default is a bold, slightly larger font.

+ `#define POPOVER_TEXTCOLOR [NSColor whiteColor]`
The text color of the matches. If you use `NSPopoverAppearanceMinimal`, you'll want to change this to a darker color

+ `#define IMAGE_ORIGIN_X_OFFSET 5`
The number of px that the image is moved over to the right. When the image is moved, it moves the text to the right as well. This has the effect of left padding for the entire cell.

+ `#define IMAGE_ORIGIN_Y_OFFSET -2`
The number of px that the image is moved down. If it's negative, the image gets moved up. You will want to change this value to get the image and text to line up, depending on the size of the images. It would be possible to find a good value for this algorithmically, but for now it's easy to make manual adjustments.

+ `#define IMAGE_PADDING 3`
The number of pixels between the image and text.
